If you'd like this README to include:
- Dynamic GitHub stats (repositories, languages) or a contributions chart
- A custom profile banner or avatar
- A short downloadable PDF CV link
tell me which and I’ll add the exact embed lines and files.

Thanks — if you want, reply with your details and I’ll generate a fully filled README.md ready to paste or I can create the profile repo for you (I'll need repo permission or you can create it and invite me).
